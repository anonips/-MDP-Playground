The file -MDP-Playground/rl_toy/envs/rl_toy_env.py contains the code for the Environments. It can be run as python rl_toy_env.py to instantiate Environments and run a random agent on them.

The code for experiments runs various Ray implementations on the Environments and will be uploaded soon after anonymising.
